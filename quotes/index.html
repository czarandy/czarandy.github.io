    <h3><i>The Age of Innocence</i></h3>
    I've been reading <i>The Age of Innocence</i>. The subtle social satire is entertaining, though sometimes hard to connect with because of the difference between the contemporary world and 1870s. My favorite parts are when situations are such that they could have happened exactly the same way today:
    <blockquote>
    The next morning Archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses. In consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived that his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was filled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life.
    </blockquote>
    <h3><i>Cannery Row</i></h3>
    In <i>Cannery Row</i>, one of the main characters, Doc, recalls a conversation:
    <blockquote>
    Blaisedell, the poet, had said to him, "You love beer so much, I.ll bet someday you.ll go in and order a beer milk shake." It was a simple piece of foolery but it had bothered Doc ever since. He wondered what a beer milk shake would taste like. The idea gagged him but he couldn.t let it alone. It cropped up every time he had a glass of beer. Would it curdle the milk? Would you add sugar? It was like a shrimp ice cream.
    </blockquote>
    Steinbeck means this to be somewhat humorous, but now, 65 years later, there actually are beer milkshakes. Indeed it's easy to find both <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5088744_make-guinness-beer-milkshake.html">guides</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE5GvmeKauM">videos</a> online<span class="footnote">Some of them incorrectly claim that the beer milkshake is due to <a href="http://reddwarf.wikia.com/wiki/Beer_milkshake">Red Dwarf</a>, but while that is a fine show the chronology here is fairly clear.</span>.

    Not only that, but shrimp ice cream is itself <a href="http://susanweinroth.typepad.com/a_little_bit_of_me/2009/05/shrimp-ice-cream-and-other-things.html">available</a>, and moreover even has its own <a href="http://www.searchamelia.com/shrimp-ice-cream-contest">eating contest</a>. John Steinbeck truly was a seer of odd food.
    <h3><i>Our Mutual Friend</i></h3>
    <p>I really enjoyed <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Mutual_Friend">Our Mutual Friend</a></i>, which has a lot of sharp satire. Although still full of social criticism, it has a lighter tone than Dickens's two previous books (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities">A Tale of Two Cities</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Expectations">Great Expectations</a></i>), and the inclusion of several ridiculous scenes makes for many a laugh-out-loud section. One bit I particularly liked involves Silas Wegg, who is hired by Mr. Boffin to read to him (as the latter is illiterate):</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"Could you begin to night, Wegg?" he then demanded.</p>
    <p>"Yes, sir," said Mr Wegg, careful to leave all the eagerness to him. "I see no difficulty if you wish it. You are provided with the needful implement.a book, sir?"</p>
    <p>"Bought him at a sale," said Mr Boffin. "Eight wollumes. Red and gold. Purple ribbon in every wollume, to keep the place where you leave off. Do you know him?"</p>
    <p>"The book's name, sir?" inquired Silas.</p>
    <p>"I thought you might have know'd him without it," said Mr Boffin slightly disappointed. "His name is Decline-And-Fall-Off-The-Rooshan-Empire." (Mr Boffin went over these stones slowly and with much caution.)</p>
    <p>"Ay indeed!" said Mr Wegg, nodding his head with an air of friendly recognition.</p>
    <p>"You know him, Wegg?"</p>
    <p>"I haven't been not to say right slap through him, very lately," Mr Wegg made answer, "having been otherways employed, Mr Boffin. But know him? Old familiar declining and falling off the Rooshan? Rather, sir! Ever since I was not so high as your stick. Ever since my eldest brother left our cottage to enlist into the army.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Of course it doesn't take long for Wegg to realize Boffin's error. How does his claim of familiarity get resolved when he learns the truth?</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"Hem!" began Wegg, "This, Mr Boffin and Lady, is the first chapter of the first wollume of the Decline and Fall off." here he looked hard at the book, and stopped.</p>
    <p>"What's the matter, Wegg?"</p>
    <p>"Why, it comes into my mind, do you know, sir," said Wegg with an air of insinuating frankness (having first again looked hard at the book), "that you made a little mistake this morning, which I had meant to set you right in, only something put it out of my head. I think you said Rooshan Empire, sir?"</p>
    <p>"It is Rooshan; ain't it, Wegg?"</p>
    <p>"No, sir. Roman. Roman."</p>
    <p>"What's the difference, Wegg?"</p>
    <p>"The difference, sir?" Mr Wegg was faltering and in danger of breaking down, when a bright thought flashed upon him. "The difference, sir? There you place me in a difficulty, Mr Boffin. Suffice it to observe, that the difference is best postponed to some other occasion when Mrs Boffin does not honour us with her company. In Mrs Boffin's presence, sir, we had better drop it."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In another amusing section, Eugene Wrayburn (who seems to get all the best lines), a barrister, is asked by Mr. Boffin whether he enjoys his work.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"A&mdash;not particularly," returned Eugene.</p>
    <p>"Too dry for you, eh? Well, I suppose it wants some years of sticking to, before you master it. But there's nothing like work. Look at the bees."</p>
    <p>"I beg your pardon," returned Eugene, with a reluctant smile, "but will you excuse my mentioning that I always protest against being referred to the bees?"</p>
    <p>"Do you!" said Mr Boffin.</p>
    <p>"I object on principle," said Eugene, "as a biped."</p>
    <p>"As a what?" asked Mr Boffin.</p>
    <p>"As a two-footed creature;&mdash;I object on principle, as a two-footed creature, to being constantly referred to insects and four-footed creatures. I object to being required to model my proceedings according to the proceedings of the bee, or the dog, or the spider, or the camel. I fully admit that the camel, for instance, is an excessively temperate person; but he has several stomachs to entertain himself with, and I have only one. Besides, I am not fitted up with a convenient cool cellar to keep my drink in."</p>
    <p>"But I said, you know," urged Mr Boffin, rather at a loss for an answer, "the bee."</p>
    <p>"Exactly. And may I represent to you that it's injudicious to say the bee? For the whole case is assumed. Conceding for a moment that there is any analogy between a bee, and a man in a shirt and pantaloons (which I deny), and that it is settled that the man is to learn from the bee (which I also deny), the question still remains, what is he to learn? To imitate? Or to avoid? When your friends the bees worry themselves to that highly fluttered extent about their sovereign, and become perfectly distracted touching the slightest monarchical movement, are we men to learn the greatness of Tuft-hunting, or the littleness of the Court Circular? I am not clear, Mr Boffin, but that the hive may be satirical."</p>
    <p>"At all events, they work," said Mr Boffin.</p>
    <p>"Ye-es," returned Eugene, disparagingly, "they work; but don't you think they overdo it? They work so much more than they need.they make so much more than they can eat.they are so incessantly boring and buzzing at their one idea till Death comes upon them.that don't you think they overdo it? And are human labourers to have no holidays, because of the bees? And am I never to have change of air, because the bees don't? Mr Boffin, I think honey excellent at breakfast; but, regarded in the light of my conventional schoolmaster and moralist, I protest against the tyrannical humbug of your friend the bee. With the highest respect for you."</p>
    </blockquote>
    Another humorous line from Eugene:
    <blockquote>
    <p>Returning to the dining-room, and pausing for an instant behind the
    screen at the door, Eugene overhears, above the hum and clatter, the
    fair Tippins saying: "I am dying to ask him what he was called out for!"</p>

    <p>"Are you?" mutters Eugene, "then perhaps if you can't ask him, you'll
    die. So I'll be a benefactor to society, and go."</p>
    </blockquote>
