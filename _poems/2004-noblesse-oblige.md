    We were potent and powerful, a dignified lot
    With our ivory towers and our meaningless knots
    We ruled all the lands from a suitable height
    While watching the weak in their infinite plight
    When one noble man in his cold, savvy air
    Watched too much of their blatant despair
    Whence called he us to do our gallant deed
    We listened and each of his words we did heed
    We followed him down to each lower house
    Where we scoffed with contempt at each utter louse
    Whilst the people thanked us deep from their core
    Whence we rose and returned from excessive rapport
      To our plated-steel windows and our triple-locked doors
      To hide midst illusions, just as before.
