Here is another poem from my high school years. Although it.s kind of depressing and I can.t say it.s my strongest piece of writing (the meter has some obvious issues), I still view it fondly.

    The lonely wanderer without a home
    Has no one--all he's ever known.
    No recollections of the past to guide
    That which he seeks is lost, inside.

    No comfort will he find out there
    Amid the frosty, gloomy air;
    And should he venture to where he dwell
    He'll find it hot as any hell.

    Though always suffering--his life defined,
    His face feigns thoughts of a gentle mind.
    Though no one stops, staring straight at him
    He feels the burden of his sin.

    So while he searches for a brief respite
    Outside, he's trapped in endless plight.
    The lonely wanderer without a home
    Will always be himself: alone.
