title: Whose Boxes These Are I Think I Know
year: 2012
---

For Beth.

    Whose boxes these are I do not know.
    They must have died long ago.
    They will not mind me looking through
    Their papers covered all in mold.

    My finding aid is very queer.
    We're using MPLP here.
    My only thought is that it'll help
    Researchers find out what is clear.

    I give the moldy page a shake
    And ask if there is some mistake.
    I hope I do not breathe too much
    Of each and every deadly flake

    The boxes are dusty, dark and deep.
    But I have to decide which ones to keep
    And miles to sort before I sleep,
    And miles to sort before I sleep.
