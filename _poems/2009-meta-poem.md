    "True ease in writing comes from art,
        not chance,"
    Pope wrote me once
        by happenstance.
    I knew at once that
        he was right
    Just as MacLeish
        with his "More Light!"

    No, wait, that's not the
        right motif
    I wanted "history of
        grief".
    Regardless, Moore
        had said it best:
    the hungry upside bat
        in quest.

    This is (you know) "the
        supreme fiction":
    Combining metaphor
        and diction.
    And so the way the poem
        doth clang:
    Not with a whimper
        but a bang!
