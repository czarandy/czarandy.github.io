title: Complicated Trees
---

    I spend my Sunday sitting under an elm tree
    And wonder what the world would be
    If trees were people and people trees
    And bees were birds and birds were bees
    Would we still have the same complications
    Or would we have no need for conversations
    Or would it be the same but in reverse
    A complicated life and then a hearse
