This is a poem I wrote in 2003, during my travails in AP English. It's got some issues with meter, which I tried to patch up now (but you'll see I didn't quite succeed). But at least it gets the message across.

    At first
      Words strewn across the page I found
    And they
      Struck me with their discordant sound
    A robin (neither here nor there)
    The wind of ages, the morning air

    Slowly
      Clarity comes into view
    The whole
      Is greater than e'er I knew
    The robin floats upon the breeze
    A fateful traveler on shifting seas

    By now
      The whole idea is lucid
    I see
      It all and nothing more is hid
    The robin is of course just me
    The gusts of wind.what is to be

    Yet wait!
      Too far have I gone in
    I've flown
      Too high into the sunny wind
    All that's left are a beak and wings
    No air stirs them, those lifeless things
