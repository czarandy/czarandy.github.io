    Miranda is sent a letter
      But it's intercepted
        By her sister

    She burns it
      Out of compassion (or just passion)
        For the boy who sent it

    Sound familiar?
      I'm sure you've heard this one before.
        Let's try another.

    Two strangers chance to meet
      On a crowded street
        They smile

    They stop and chat a while
      And when the evening ends
        They part as more than friends

    They set a date to meet again
      But when it comes around
        One of them forgets the time (and place)

    How sad, you think, and yes how trite.
      But then again it's hard to write
        Completely new ideas.

    These tropes are key
      To some of the
        Greatest Novels.

    But that was then--
      What are contemporary writers to do?
        In this world of cell phones and the internet.

    Miranda gets a text
      And she runs off with Leo
        They live happily ever after

    The strangers find each other online
      And arrange a new meeting
        They live happily ever after

    Sure, it's great to make lives better and people happier.
      But isn't it a little sad for novels?
        To see the death of age-old conflicts.

The argument is not necessarily one I'm inclined to agree with, but it does make me a bit wistful when I think about it.
