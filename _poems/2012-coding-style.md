title: His Coding Style is Very Queer
---

    Who wrote this code I do not know.
    He quit this job so long ago.
    He will not mind me looking here
    To find the bug that makes it slow.

    His coding style is very queer
    There's hardly any logic here
    To understand it, it would take
    At least another dozen beers.

    I give my monitor a shake!
    Why can't I find that one mistake?
    It's something simple that I seek
    Perhaps a switch missing a break.

    The code is buggy, slow and cheap
    But I still have this memory leak.
    And lines to code before I sleep.
    And lines to code before I sleep.
