title: The Empty Highway

    The clouds roll by
    On the empty highway.
    Slow and silent--
    We never notice their struggles.

    Below them a child cries:
    She wants to eat some candy.
    The whole world stops to watch--
    Caught up in the frenzy.

I think the theme I was shooting for is that it's hard to know what's truly important in the world.
