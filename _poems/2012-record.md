    Names are important
    When two things share a name
    Thinking of one immediately
      conjures
    Thoughts of the other
      (like a magician)

    "Record" is a potent name
    (Music is a product of history)
    Listening to Miles Davis
    You feel, not only
    kind of blue
    But all the fifties washing over you

    "Album" is likewise powerful
    It brings to mind
    A collection of pictures
      at an exhibition
    Say, or a book of sketches
      of Spain
    Perhaps. The music brings
    To mind those places

    "Single" is so melancholy
    You listen by yourself and think
    This song is just like me
    It even has a companion
    A sidekick like Batgirl
    (Or my dog Brian)

    These names will fade away in time
    We will replace them with new ones
    But really we should do better
      MP3, FLAC, AAC
    They do not evoke any connections
    And leave no space for
      Poetic possibilities
