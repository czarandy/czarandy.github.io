When I see you my heart it flutters
Is there a stunning angel before me
Light that would pierce the darkest window shutters
Love in your smile is all my eyes can see

Your fair blond locks they dance and sparkle
Over a face that smiles bright like the sun
Unburdened grace your moves so artful
My litte zor I love you like no one

After the years we've spent together
Roads have we travelled down and mountains crossed
Rivers we've forded in the toughest weather
Yet with you never was I feeling lost

May we continue hand in hand this journey
Ever my love please will you marry me
?
