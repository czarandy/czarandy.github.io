title: Ode to the Daisy
year: 2006

    Amidst the barren landscape
      \ Of the dead and wintry world
    My sullen, somber footsteps
        \ Are all that can be heard
    And the chilly wind that blows
          \ Envelops all around
    And the falling snow it carries
            \ Covers the pallid ground

    Lo! Upon this starless night
              \ No treasure to be seen
    I've walked through countless
                \ Many cities of ruin
    Yet the only living soul
                  \ That I have yet to see
    Is my own shallow reflection
                    \ In the tearful Mackenzie
    And yet from hope's eternal spring
                      \ A divine gift is brought to me
    In clearing white a flower true
                        \ Alone and scarlet: a daisy

    I rush headlong fantastically
                          \ How to believe my holy luck?
    And gazing down on this last best hope
                            \ Flora herself--dare I pluck?
    No time have I to contemplate
                              \ With splendor so apparent
    With thought I would anticipate
                                \ My last move: oh 'tis errant
    Instead I act on this forlorn day
                                  \ I pick it
                                    \ And it blows away
