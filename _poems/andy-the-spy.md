    About nine years ago
    In a country across the sea
    There lived a spy named Andy G.
    He came here for what he thought
    Was he'd restore Russia but he got caught
    The authority took him to the courtroom and he lost
    And their response it didn't thrill him
    They put him in a gas chamber and tried to kill him
    But Russia came and set him free
    And that's what started World War Three
    They started bombing here and there
    The survivors, they all had no hair
    And we all thought it wasn't fair
    All because of this here spy...

    Oh my, my, this here Andy the spy
    Sucked at spying so we're dying
    Cause he's a bad spy
    He left his home and kissed mother Russia good bye
    Saying "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"
    "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"

    Do you know this here Russian spy
    On his next mission he'd probably die
    Because he sucks at spying they say
    Oh do you see him crossing on that screen
    Yes you can so that would mean
    That he'd probably be caught today
    His code name is double 0
    Cause that's the bytes that he downloads
    And his leg was broke it's true
    And he had a black eye or two
    He was not a real good fighting ace
    The minute the security guard shot at his face
    With that canister filled with mace
    Oh yes, he was, in pain...

    Oh my, my, this here Andy the spy
    Sucked at spying, but he's trying
    To be a good spy
    He left his home and kissed mother Russia good bye
    Saying "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"
    "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"

    So they finally go to the courtroom
    The verdict--it could prove our doom
    Because all the countries were ****ed, they say
    They took him there, and they told the tale
    How his spying skills were on a negative scale
    And how he should be killed someday
    Well the jury was impressed of course
    Could he change the balance of the nuclear force
    They interviewed the kid
    His survival they forbid
    Because Americans had much fear
    But Russia said now listen here
    Stick it in all of your ears
    We will, set free, this boy...

    Oh my, my, this here Andy the spy
    Sucked at spying so we're dying
    Cause he's a bad spy
    He left his home and kissed mother Russia good bye
    Saying "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"
    "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"

    We spied all of Pennsylvania Avenue
    Because Andy Goder wanted to
    I thought we could have tried to hide
    Every country fought in that Armageddon war
    It wasn't long at all before
    Russia sent some nukes to end the day
    And in the end everybody died
    Countries blew up
    And people fried
    A lot of folks were smoking
    Everything we made was broken
    And the planet we admired most
    Got hit by a nuke and now it's toast
    The only thing left is the cockroach
    I guess, they'll rule the world
    We were saying...

    Oh my, my, this here Andy the spy
    Sucked at spying so we're dying
    Cause he's a bad spy
    He left his home and kissed mother Russia good bye
    Saying "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"
    "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"

    The roaches were singing...

    We like this here Andy the spy
    Because he sucks at spying so they're dying
    So we rule this world
    He left his home and kissed mother Russia good bye
    Saying "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"
    "Soon I'm going to be a good spy"
