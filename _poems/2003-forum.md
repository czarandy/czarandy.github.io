Here is another poem I wrote in high school. And there's a good chance that high school was exactly what I was writing about.

    When every word reeks of inanity
    And every phrase
    An endless haze
    You're in the forum of insanity

    When every wish is a calamity
    And every thought
    The jester wrought
    You're in the forum of insanity

    "I must be free from this immanity!"
    A hopeful scream
    Lost in the dream
    That is the forum of insanity

    There's nothing left of your humanity
    You lie destroyed
    Amidst a void
    Filled by the forum of insanity
