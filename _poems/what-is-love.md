title: What is Love?
year: 2004
---

    What is love to a flower?
    Sitting so pretty on her stalk
    She prides in forcing us to gawk
    At her delightful power

    What is love to a bird?
    She sings a song so pure and sweet
    That we are swept clear off our feet
    At the mere thought of what we.ve heard

    What is love to the stars?
    They shine the light of million lives
    That wink right back, and look so far
    At what allows them to survive

    But what is love to one as I?
    To match such beauty I can but try
    And stopping short along the way
    These words of love, to you I say
