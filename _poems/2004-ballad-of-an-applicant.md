    Alone on empty waves of blue
    Amidst the serene sea
    The surface broken by my oars
    Advancing steadily

    The tiny speck that was my boat
    Creaked with each passing row
    Among the azure sky I felt
    The clouds begin to grow

    The crackle of the ocean air
    Blew froth into the sky
    The colors shifting towards the dark
    My sole defense: a sigh

    And with this heave a torrent came
    The blackness burst to blue
    Still I unfazed by sudden drench
    The flurry paddled through

    A billow blew--the battle cry
    The waves were up in arms!
    A crash engulfed the tiny speck
    As emptiness wrought harm

    Against this endless hurricane
    Compelling me to cease
    I had but simple will of mind
    My inward mental peace

    The oars could not contain themselves
    With shrapnel in my eyes
    I broke through blusterous barricade
    Blinded by shining skies

    And as I lay barely afloat
    On scattered scraps of wood
    A lone and wary seagull flew
    Up where I never could

    No longer lone on waves of blue
    The sea a calm cascade
    Then hit the beach with sudden crash!
    To black the world did fade

    And so I land on scraggy shores
    With manifold debris
    Oh fabled Academia!
    I bring myself to thee.
