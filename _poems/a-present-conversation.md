This is a poem I wrote way back in high school. I must have been trying to use some of that French I "studied" for four years.

    "Comment ca va?"
      The Frenchman said.
    "J'ai oublie,"
      I shook my head.
    "How can that be?"
      Monsieur, surprised.
    "No matter now,"
      Into his eyes.
    "If only we,"
      Now lost in thought.
    "Ah, but we do,"
      That which he sought.
    "But forget what?"
      Him grasping, blind.
    "What happens now."
      Out of his mind.
