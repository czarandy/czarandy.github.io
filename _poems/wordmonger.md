    "Try it on," she said,
    "Make sure that it feels right.
    Check that it's not too loose
    And not too tight."

    It felt good, balanced, with a hint of poise.
    I had a single reservation.

    "Am I...the first?" I asked.
    She smiled.
    "Our quality is high, to be sure.
    And the provenance of each item pure.
    Yet for the price you can't expect
    An entirely new prospect."

    "Ah," I sighed.
    I didn't really think it'd be.
    But still, I held out hope.

    She saw my sullen look, and said:
    "I'll give you some advice.
    If you want something new
    But can't afford the price
    Then do as Shakespeare did
    And let it from inside you sprout.
    For it costs but a coin to go this route."

    I smiled at her.
    And gave her back the word
    And hurried home
    And so my voice was heard.
