title: As Love Falls Apart
year: 2003
---

    They said that love would conquer all.
    They told me it was but a matter of time.
    But sitting by my window,
    Watching white clouds roll by,
    I think of the home I love.
    The one with everything I need
    And nothing I don't.
    The one I haven't been to in years.

    They said that life was beautiful.
    They told me that there was hope for everyone.
    But lying in my bed,
    Dreaming my worthless dream,
    I think only of her.
    Her with the light blue eyes
    And pleasant smile.
    Her that I haven't seen in years.

    They said all those things and more.
    Yet still my dreams are years away.
    If I'd have known then,
    It might have been different.
    But only now do I realize that
    These are just words they say,
    As love falls apart.
