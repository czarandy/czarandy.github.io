    She dropped a strand of hair
    Rushing by in the park
    It landed on my arm

    Only later did I notice
    The scarlet scintillate
    Against my plain jacket

    I reached to grab it
    But competition was fierce
    A gust beat me to it

    As I stare at my empty hand
    I wonder how many times
    I've missed them before

Apparently in 2004 I was really worried about missing out on things.
