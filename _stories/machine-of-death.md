Maya never really knew how she started working on the Machine. She had always been attracted to unusual projects, but
this one was certainly strange even for her. A device that could predict any person's death? The idea sounded ludicrous
when she first heard it, and yet it was exactly the scope of the challenge that drew her in. Thousands felt the same way,
and the Machine became one of the largest efforts the world had ever seen.

Those early years were full of such promise, of such excitement. Everyone working on the project felt the palpable air of
excitement. Few knew how the Machine actually worked--Maya was not one of them. Her focus was on the interface users would see
when they received their prediction. She was nevertheless proud to be responsible for that, even if it wasn't part of the
Machine's internal workings. Maya felt it was certainly important that when people learned their Grim Fate that the presentation
was appropriately somber. She would always look back on those three years of work as being the best of her life. It was amazing to be a part of something so world-changing.

In the fourth year of work, it was with some shock that Maya realized the Machine was actually nearing completion. Preliminary
testing began on death row inmates, which governments around the world were more than willing to provide. Later tests on terminally-ill
patients confirmed the accuracy of the Machine's predictions. Maya was as surprised as anyone at its accuracy. She had always felt that
there was no such thing as fate, that although death could be predicted with some degree of precision, it was impossible for the Machine to always be
correct. But that was before Sammy Laxidor.

Sammy was a patient at the local hospital, ill with pancreatic cancer. Doctors gave him less than a month to live at the time he volunteered
to be part of the next trial of the Machine. This batch of volunteers would be using Maya's software, so although Maya was rarely present at the tests, she
attended this one. Nothing much surprising happened until Sammy was brought in his wheelchair. He inserted his finger into the Machine, and the screen
lit up. Maya wasn't paying too much attention to what was going on with Sammy. She was busy being pleased that her interface was working exactly
as she intended. But after Sammy's prediction showed up on the screen the room suddenly became quiet. Maya became worried that something had gone wrong, so she
stepped closer to the screen to see. There, in the full somber glory of her beautiful design, was Sammy's prediction: <span style="font-variant: small-caps">WALMART</span>.

This was certainly odd. Why would a terminal cancer patient die of Walmart-related causes? Maya was mystefied. Perhaps the Machine was not as infallible as
they claimed. Before she had any longer to look at the screen, someone shut it down and motioned everyone out of the room. She met with her boss, who told her to
go home for the day--they would discuss this further tomorrow. Although Maya had never really believed that the Machine could be so accurate, she still
spent the rest of the day worried that the project would be scrapped and she'd be out of a job. At least her interface had shown the fateful message in style.
Hopefully they won't shoot the messenger, she thought.

The next day the whole office was abuzz. Not everyone knew what had happened the previous day; some had just been abruptly sent home without an explanation. Maya
wanted to stay out of the spotlight so she didn't talk with anyone about what she knew. It wasn't long before they all received an e-mail telling them to
"continue as usual" and that the previous day's stir was "nothing to worry about". Maya was confused. Hadn't they shown the Machine's fallibility? In any case,
she didn't have too much to work on now that her interface was performing as expected. She spent her day surfing the web and reading random news stories. After some time,
there was one item that caught her eye. It wasn't very prominent, but somehow she knew that she should read it. There had been a large accident on the highway just outside of
town. Involved were two cars, an ambulance, and a Walmart truck. A chill ran down Maya's spine. The word she had seen the prior day on the display flashed in front of her. The article didn't mention any deaths or the names of anyone involved, but she knew that it had to be. The Machine worked.

A few weeks after that testing was concluded, and they announced that the Machine had been correct in every case. There was surprisingly little public interest. It seemed that at
first no one really understood the ramifications of knowing even a little about one's ultimate fate. To drum up publicity ahead of opening the Machine to the public they
"encouraged" all the employees to get their own predictions on the machine. You didn't have to actually look at what it said, but all the predictions were recorded for later.
e changed her mind.
