#### Libraritarian

After the war, everything was destroyed. With so few of us we couldn’t rebuild, not without records. After searching, we finally found the last library. The librarian had kept it safe, so we hailed her as our leader. With her books we were able to start over. She guided us into a brighter future, based on the sound principle of borrowing. Society’s returned to normal now, and it turns out having a librarian in charge is pretty great. I barely mind having to talk in hushed whispers, and the late fees for my shoes will be paid off next year.
